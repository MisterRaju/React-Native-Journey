## 💡 What This Is

This isn't another tutorial repo. **This is proof of work.**

Instead of scattered bookmarks, forgotten notes, and repeated mistakes, this repository exists to:

| 🎯 Purpose | 📝 Action |
|-----------|----------|
| **Daily Learning** | Capture what I learn every day |
| **Problem Solving** | Document real-world issues and solutions |
| **Resource Hub** | Collect battle-tested libraries and patterns |
| **Consistency** | Build momentum through small updates |

> 💭 *This is about showing how I learn, not how much I know.*

<br>

## 🤔 Why This Exists

Learning React Native goes **beyond components**. It's about understanding:

## 🎯 Update Philosophy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Small updates > Perfect updates    │
│  Consistency > Intensity            │
│  Public learning = Accountability   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Some days = code  
Some days = notes  
Some days = just links  

**Even a single useful insight is worth committing.** 💪
